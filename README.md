**What it does**  
Adds advanced reporting, scheduled reminders, and weekly summaries for MemberPress Gift memberships.

**Why I built it**  
As a Tier-3 Support Engineer working deeply inside the MemberPress ecosystem, I repeatedly saw the same reporting gaps.  
Instead of documenting workarounds, I built a scalable, standards-compliant solution and shipped it to WordPress.org.

**What this demonstrates**
- ✔ Passed WordPress.org plugin review  
- ✔ Follows WordPress coding standards  
- ✔ Built for real production environments  
- ✔ Actively maintained and supported

## 🧠 Development Philosophy

I build tools that solve:

- Subscription edge cases  
- Reporting limitations  
- Billing workflow friction  
- Admin inefficiencies  
- Support-heavy recurring scenarios  

**Framework**

Problem → Constraints → Clean Implementation → Maintainable Architecture → Public Release
