# 👋 Hi, I'm **Omar El-Hawary**

### **WordPress & MemberPress Developer | Product-Minded Support Engineer | Future PM**

I build **real-world WordPress plugins** that solve high-impact problems for MemberPress customers and internal support teams.  
My work lives at the intersection of **engineering, support, product strategy, and automation**.

I care deeply about:
- Crafting tools that **reduce manual work**
- Turning **support insights → product decisions**
- Building reliable **billing, reporting, and membership workflows**
- Exploring **AI-driven solutions** for support and operations
- Preparing myself for a transition into **Product Management**

## 🎯 **What I’m Working On**

- Building internal tools that simplify support workflows

- Exploring **AI integrations** for MemberPress + WordPress  
- Strengthening my roadmap, planning, and product-thinking skills  
- Preparing for a hybrid path: **Support → APM → Product Manager**

## 🧠 **My Engineering Approach**

### **1. Solve real problems, not theoretical ones**  
All major projects I build come directly from real customer pain points.

### **2. Think in terms of workflows, not features**  
“Who is the user? What friction do they feel? How do we reduce that friction?”

### **3. Build with reliability first**  
Batching, cron safety, logs, error handling, and clear admin UI.

### **4. Always document**  
A plugin is only useful if admins understand it.

### **5. Treat every plugin like a product**  
Changelogs, releases, versioning, UX, and support instructions.
