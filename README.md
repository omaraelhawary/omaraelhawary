While working as a Tier-3 Support Engineer inside the MemberPress ecosystem,
I consistently encountered reporting gaps around Gift memberships. Instead of repeating workarounds, I designed and shipped a scalable solution to WordPress.org.

**What it delivers:** Advanced gift reporting · Scheduled reminder emails · Weekly summary automation · Clean exportable data · Production-grade architecture
