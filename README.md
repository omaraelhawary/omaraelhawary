## 👋 Hi, I’m Omar ElHawary

I’m a **Technical Consultant / Solutions Engineer** with 7+ years of experience working with SaaS products and WordPress-based platforms.

My focus is helping companies and customers **design, implement, and troubleshoot complex technical solutions** — especially around memberships, subscriptions, payments, APIs, and integrations.

I work closely with customers, support teams, and engineers to bridge the gap between **business requirements and technical execution** in real-world production environments.

- API integrations and webhook-driven workflows

## 🧠 My Engineering & Consulting Approach

### 1. Solve real production problems  
All projects are driven by real customer use cases, not theoretical examples.

### 2. Think in workflows, not features  
Understanding how users interact with systems end-to-end is key.

### 3. Build for reliability first  
Batching, cron safety, logging, error handling, and predictable behavior.

### 4. Documentation is part of the solution  
Clear documentation reduces friction, support load, and misuse.

### 5. Treat every tool like a product  
Versioning, changelogs, UX clarity, and maintainability always matter.
