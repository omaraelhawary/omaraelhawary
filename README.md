# 👋 Hi, I'm Omar El-Hawary

**WordPress & MemberPress Developer**

For the past 3+ years, I’ve been building real-world WordPress & MemberPress solutions that solve actual customer problems — from reporting tools to internal automations and billing workflows.  
My work lives at the intersection of **support, product thinking, and engineering**.

I focus on:
- 🔧 Developing custom MemberPress plugins & automation tools  
- 🧩 Improving billing, reporting, and membership workflows  
- 📊 Turning support insights into real product improvements  
- 🤖 Exploring AI-driven product ideas and internal tooling  
- 🎯 Preparing for my transition into **Product Management**
